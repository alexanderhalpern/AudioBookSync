# AudioBookSync

Welcome to AudioBookSync! Sync up the book that you are reading with the Audiobook. If you are frequently switching between reading a book and listening to the audiobook for that book, you might have thought that it takes a ton of time to sync up where you are between the audio and physical text format. AudioBookSync allows you to search for just a few key words that indicate where you are in the physical book and receive the exact timestamp of where you are in the audiobook.
